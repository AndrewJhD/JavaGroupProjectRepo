# JavaGroupProjectRepo
my group project with another classmate
The project is a pet catalog for pet owners for a town to register their pet in case it ever gets loose or for use in statistics for the towns government.
Using the simple web gui you can register your pets name and species and then their information gets attached to your account which can be looked up with the owners id.
